Welcome to StorageSwap!
(by Beatrice Farb, Heidi Lai, and Mei Tercek 2018)

StorageSwap is an online marketplace designed for individuals to rent out extra storage space they may have in their homes to
those who need some temporary storage space! The basic structure is as follows:

1) Users can register as either a buyer or a seller and must be logged in to view any other part of the site. Initially to create a
profile, press "buy" or "sell" in the upper right of the homepage.

2) There are different interfaces for buyers and sellers:

    - Sellers can post listings at the address they registered with setting the price per box, number of boxes they have space for, type
    of setting, and dates they are offering the space for. They can have as many listings as they wish for their given address. Press
    "make a listing" in the nav bar to create a new listing, which will be added to the SQL datatable "listings".

    - Buyers can search for listings based on parameters such as location, range in miles that is acceptable for the listing to be in,
    number of boxes, and dates they need the space for. The listings are returned in order of price low to high. To access the
    feature to search through listings, press "Search" in the navigation bar.

    - Buyers and sellers each have profile pages which contain basic information including the user's name, username, and
    contact information (email, phone number). Seller profile pages have an additional feature of a list of their listings (click
    on the listing links to access).

3) Buyers and sellers can interact via messages, and this is where they can further negotiate prices and dates:

    - Buyers can send messages to a seller to request a listing if they click on a listing in the search results. This message will
    be logged, and buyers can view the messages they have sent in the "Messages" tab of the nav bar. If they receive responses,
    they can respond via the "Reply" button next to the message on the Messages page.

    - Sellers receive messages discussing their listings, which they can view in the "Messages" tab. Again, they can reply to
    messages they have received via the "Reply" button next to the message on the Messages page.

To access the website, enter the folder "~workspace/storageswap/" and flask run in the command line, then click on the resulting
hyperlink.
